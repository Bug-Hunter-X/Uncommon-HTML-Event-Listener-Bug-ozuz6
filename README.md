This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to event listeners in HTML. The initial `bug.html` file contains a function that modifies the content of a div element when a button is clicked. However, it lacks the crucial step of removing the event listener after its first execution. This omission leads to the event listener being added repeatedly, resulting in unexpected and potentially infinite behavior after subsequent clicks. The `solution.html` file provides a corrected version that addresses this issue by removing the event listener before adding it again.
